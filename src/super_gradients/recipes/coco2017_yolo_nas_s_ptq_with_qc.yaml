# YoloNAS-S Detection training on COCO2017 Dataset:
# This training recipe is for demonstration purposes only. Pretrained models were trained using a different recipe.
# So it will not be possible to reproduce the results of the pretrained models using this recipe.

# Instructions:
#   0. Make sure that the data is stored in dataset_params.dataset_dir or add "dataset_params.data_dir=<PATH-TO-DATASET>" at the end of the command below (feel free to check ReadMe)
#   1. Move to the project root (where you will find the ReadMe and src folder)
#   2. Run the command you want:
#         yolo_nas_s: python src/super_gradients/examples/train_from_recipe_example/train_from_recipe.py --config-name=coco2017_yolo_nas_s
